# BailProject

This repository currently contains a web scraper to collect the jail rosters for several counties in Mississippi. We are collecting this information on behalf of [The Bail Project](https://bailproject.org/).

This repository is an improved version of https://github.com/nsubbaian/BailProject.

Changes:
- Web Scraper
  - Rewrote web scraper from scratch
    - Web scrapers now include previously missing data
    - Web scrapers are designed to use a single format for the data, rather than a different format per county
